# TMR-Soccer-Junior
This repository contains some of the work I made for the team Galacticos for the Mexican Robotics Tournament 2019.

We participated in the Robocup Soccer Open Junior category. Here we had to develop two soccer player autonomous robots.

In the gif below you can see how one of our robots scored a goal.
