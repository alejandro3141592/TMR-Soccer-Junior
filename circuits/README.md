Here I present some photos of some electronic circuits that we used in the robot, unfortunately, I do not have the board or the .gerber files anymore, but you can have some idea of the logic of the circuits.
It is important to mention that by this time many of the circuits were made in perforated plates rather than in custom PCBs, so I only had the chance to design two PCBs.

The first PCB consisted of a series of LEDs and phototransistors, that, when a change in the intensity of the light reflected by the field was detected (when crossing from the green grass to the withe lane), a signal was sent to the microcontroller, as seen below.

The second circuit was made to control the selenoid in charge of kicking the ball, this was needed as a power amplifier, and because of the high reverse current the selenoid returned to the circuit.
