Here I present the code that we used for the Arduino Mega board, developed in 2018-2019, it was one of the first big projects I worked on, sure there are a lot of things that I could have done in a better way, but it was the beginning of my whole career.

Here you can see some gifs of the results achieved with this code (we were the team with the blue goal):
